            The English language is oftentimes confusing for those learning the language, sometimes even for 
            native speakers, puzzled by its inconsistent grammar rules and interesting slang. Today, I am 
            addressing an issue I personally have with the English grammar rules for plural words, which I'm 
            certain you'll find agreeable. <br>

    </div>    
    <div class="standard_rules">
        <p>
            The singular for sheep should be called <em>shoop</em>. Before you call me crazy, let me walk you through 
            my sound reasoning. Below, I have replicated a table that details standard rules for forming plurals <sup>[1]</sup>:

            As you can see, there are a variety of rules for changing the singular tense of a noun to plural.
            For most words, you just add an "s" to the end of the word to make it plural. However, as 
            explained on Grammarly, there are many exceptions to this rule:
            <blockquote cite="https://www.grammarly.com/blog/irregular-plural-nouns/#:~:text=Irregular%20plural%20nouns%20are%20nouns,woman%20is%20women%2C%20not%20womans.">
                Irregular plural nouns are nouns that do not become plural by adding 
                -s or -es, as most nouns in the English language do. You're probably 
                familiar with many of these already...There are hundreds of irregular 
                plural nouns, and in truth, you must memorize them through reading and 
                speaking. There are, however, some common patterns to look out for. <sup>[2]</sup>
            </blockquote>
            One such pattern is with words that have "oo" double vowels: such as tooth, goose, foot, etc. For 
            these irregular nouns, there is a vowel change from "oo" to "ee" - tooth becomes teeth, goose 
            becomes geese, foot becomes feet, etc.
        </p>

    </div>    
    <div class="ee_nouns">
        <p>
            I know what you're going to say: sheep is not the same as these irregular nouns, it has "ee" and 
            not "oo" in the word, so it should instead continue to follow the standard plural rules for "ee"
            nouns. Many "ee" words follow the standard rule of most nouns in adding an "s" at the end, such 
            queen to queens, bee to bees, green to greens, etc. However, the current plural form of sheep 
            does not even follow this rule! The irregular noun sheep's plural form is also sheep - how 
            confusing is that!!! Are you talking about a single sheep or multiple sheep? <b>I DON'T KNOW!</b>

    <div class="shoop_conclusion">
        <p>
            Now that we have reached a consensus that one of the tenses of sheep should be changed to avoid 
            further confusion, why should the singular of sheep be shoop instead of the plural tense of sheep be 
            sheeps? Perhaps you think the plural of sheep should be sheeps to follow the precedent set by
            all the other "ee" nouns. However, since we are working to change the tense of sheep anyways, why 
            give up the chance to say the word <strong>SHOOP</strong>?! The gratification of saying the word shoop to refer to 
            singular sheep is also supported by the existing "oo" rule we previously mentioned, so you would
            still be grammatically correct!

            If you've made it this far, thank you and I hope you agree with my passionate argument. If not, 
            I ask you to further take the time to digest this insightful assertion and reconsider. As a continuation 
            of this food for thought, I also think the plural of moose should be called meese.
